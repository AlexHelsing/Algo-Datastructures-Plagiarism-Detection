Task 1: Analyzing the slow program
----------------------------------

**Question**
What is the asymptotic complexity of findSimilarity?
Answer in terms of N, the total number of 5-grams in the input files.
Assume that the number of duplicate occurrences of 5-grams is a small constant - that is, there is not much plagiarised text.
Explain briefly.

Give the path to the document set: documents/small
Reading all input files took 0,06 seconds.
Building n-gram index took 0,00 seconds.
Computing similarity scores took 2,74 seconds.
Finding the most similar files took 0,01 seconds.
In total the program took 2,80 seconds.

Balance statistics:
  files: BST, size 7, height 7
  index: BST, size 0, height 0
  similarity: BST, size 16, height 16

Plagiarism report:
   80 similarity: documents\small\Find me.txt and documents\small\Plagiarism.txt

   32 similarity: documents\small\Hamlet.txt and documents\small\To be, or not to be.txt
   30 similarity: documents\small\Find me.txt and documents\small\To be, or not to be.txt

Give the path to the document set: documents/medium
Reading all input files took 0,20 seconds.
Building n-gram index took 0,00 seconds.
Computing similarity scores took 565,77 seconds.
Finding the most similar files took 0,02 seconds.
In total the program took 565,99 seconds.

TODO

**Question**
How long did the program take on the 'small' and 'medium' directories?
Is the ratio between the times what you would expect,
given the asymptotic complexity? Explain very briefly why.

TODO

**Question**
How long do you predict the program would take to run on
the 'huge' directory? Show your calculations.

TODO

Task 2: Using an index
----------------------

**Question**
Which of the three BSTs in the program usually become unbalanced?
Say very briefly:
- how you observed this,
- why you think this is the case.

TODO

**Question** (optional)
Is there a simple way to stop these trees becoming unbalanced?

TODO (optional)

Task 3: Using scapegoat trees instead of BSTs
---------------------------------------------

For the below questions, we denote by N the total number of 5-grams.
We assume there is a (small) constant number of duplicate occurrences of 5-grams.

**Question**
What is the asymptotic complexity of buildIndex?
Justify briefly.

TODO

**Question**
What is the asymptotic complexity of findSimilarity?
Justify briefly.

TODO

**Question** (optional)
Instead of the previous assumption, we now allow an arbitrary total similarity score S.
Express the asymptotic complexity of the two functions in terms of both N and S (at the same time).

TODO (optional)

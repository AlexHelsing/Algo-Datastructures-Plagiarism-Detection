Task 1: Analyzing the slow program
----------------------------------

**Question**
What is the asymptotic complexity of findSimilarity?
Answer in terms of N, the total number of 5-grams in the input files.
Assume that the number of duplicate occurrences of 5-grams is a small constant - that is, there is not much plagiarised text.
Explain briefly.

TODO

**Question**
How long did the program take on the 'small' and 'medium' directories?
Is the ratio between the times what you would expect,
given the asymptotic complexity? Explain very briefly why.

TODO

**Question**
How long do you predict the program would take to run on
the 'huge' directory? Show your calculations.

TODO

Task 2: Using an index
----------------------

**Question**
Which of the three BSTs in the program usually become unbalanced?
Say very briefly:
- how you observed this,
- why you think this is the case.

TODO

**Question** (optional)
Is there a simple way to stop these trees becoming unbalanced?

TODO (optional)

Task 3: Using scapegoat trees instead of BSTs
---------------------------------------------

For the below questions, we denote by N the total number of 5-grams.
We assume there is a (small) constant number of duplicate occurrences of 5-grams.

**Question**
What is the asymptotic complexity of buildIndex?
Justify briefly.

TODO

**Question**
What is the asymptotic complexity of findSimilarity?
Justify briefly.

TODO

**Question** (optional)
Instead of the previous assumption, we now allow an arbitrary total similarity score S.
Express the asymptotic complexity of the two functions in terms of both N and S (at the same time).

TODO (optional)
